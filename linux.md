> `exit`, `logout`, or `Ctrl-d` - Exits the shell or your current session.  

`which <commandName>`  to see command path.  

---

`cd -` to navigate previous working directory.  

`mkdir [-p] directory` - Create a directory. Use the -p (parents) option to create intermediate directories.  

`rm -rf directory` Recursively removes the directory and all files and directories in that directory structure.

> When you use the -F option for ls a character is appended to the file name that reveals what type it is.

`ls -lF`

> / Directory.  
> @ Link. The file that follows the -> symbol is the target of the link.  
> * Executable program.  

`ls -latr` sort them by time, but in reverse order.  
`ls -R` to see all directory and files.  
`tree` List content of directories in a tree-like format.  
`tree -d`  List directories only.  

---

`groups <groupName>` to see users of specific group.  

> `chmod` The change mode command.

> ugoa The user category. One or more of u for user, g for group, o for other, a for all.

> +-= One of +, -, or =. Use + to add permissions, - to subtract them, or = to explicitly set them.  

> rwx The permissions. One or more of r for read, w for write, and x for execute.  

> you can give permissions with numeric too.

##### Examples for chmod

`chmod g+w sales.data`  
`chmod g+wx sales.data`  
`chmod u=rwx,g+x sales.data`  
`chmod a=r` then only read will be available regardless of any existing permissions. Result : -r--r--r--  
`chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=` Result : -rwxr-x---  

**If you are sure a file's permissions have been set correctly, look at the parent directory.**
`ls -ld` to see current directory permission.  

`umask <octalNumber>` to set umask.  
`umask -S` to see default umask settings.

`cp -r source_directory destination` Copy source_directory recursively to destination. If destination exists, copy source_directory into destination, otherwise create destination with the contents of directory.

`ls here not-here 2> out.err`  

> If you want to capture both standard output and standard error, use 2>&1.  

`ls here not-here > out.both 2>&1`  
`cat sample.txt &> out` short way  
`command 2> error.txt 1> output.txt` to send different file.
